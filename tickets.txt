get chart to either not render or hide itself on creation
then show itself again
trouble with getting it to not render itself in beforeRender
got it to hide itself in afterRender but had to wait animation times
so set duration to 0 or set animations to false either set in config.options or modify config.options in beforeRender
    handleAfterInitialRender is true so afterRender will run
    afterRender will begin immediately since animation.duration is 0
    if duration 0
        call chart hide which will hide immediately
        set duration to 1000
    afterRender will begin immediately
    if duration not 0
        set handleAfterInitialRender to false
    handleAfterInitialRender is set to false so afterRender will not run
downside of hiding itself is duration is hardcoded for all charts



setAppHeight now sets original aspect ratio and should have its name changed


update user stats in local storage (for each end selection)
create screen to display user stats


add to local storage handler
    user stats
        high_score
        longest_word
        game_count
        wins
        losses
        ties
        word_count
        word_length_distribution
        average score


css sizing should fit a square screen (edge case)


consider in addSelectedCell making it class based (add remove class) instead of dom manipulation


recoop naming conventions they got way out of alignment
update vs set naming convention


consider cases in API and DB where you can replace ['attr'] with .attr


css is likely a mess needs to be looked at and cleaned
srange widths, 100% vs inherit, refine current organization
create css vars for named sizes like font size and width
    then have claude write names for isolating sizes


implement friend game
if friend game initiated make sure to check if username has changed


implement random game


generate gameboards during downtime to dish out later


gameboards shouldn't contain >2 of the same letter


gameboards made with word injection should follow a defined distribution
    to ensure not every board will have a 14/15 letter word
    some boards may just have a 9/10 letter word
    this makes the highest scoring words rare
