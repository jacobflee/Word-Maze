if friend game initiated make sure to check if username has changed


pattern where parent has listener with mult children and decide which child was hit


on username change success
blur
then show message
them retract message


add extra div to create disappearing border to input username and top friend card


all username form and input error conditions matched generically for friend search
first goal to to change all username set functions to handle input generically


game.time not necessary in freeplay


you dont need to store friendIds and friendNames in localStorage
you could just create them on open since
the majority of the compute is array to set


could make it so friend list isnt repopulated fully each time
would only reduce js compute not reduce repaints


grid of friendCards has css that makes each card a specific width?
that's stupid bro


consider in addSelectedCell making it class based (add remove class) instead of dom manipulation


navControls being only in the free play header is odd, maybe?


userName input max 25 once you hit N characters the padding disappears and looks bad


update vs set


implement startMode and friendSearch


onconnect and ondisconnect update database that user is online


create screen to display user stats


implement local storage handler
    user id
        user name
        user ids (friends)
        user stats
            high_score
            longest_word
            game_count
            wins
            losses
            ties
            word_count
            word_length_distribution


after each game update local storage user stats


config make COLORS.CELL.XXX among other more specific sub categories


fix naming (selectedLetters is current word text)


create css vars for named sizes like font size and width
    then have claude write names for isolating sizes


generate gameboards during downtime to dish out later


gameboards shouldn't contain >2 of the same letter


gameboards made with word injection should follow a distribution
    to ensure not every board will have a 14/15 letter word
    some boards may just have a 9/10 letter word
    this makes the highest scoring words rare
