    user id

            wins
            losses
            ties
            word_count
            word_length_distribution


after each game update local storage user stats


config make COLORS.CELL.XXX among other more specific sub categories


fix naming (selectedLetters is current word text)


create css vars for named sizes like font size and width
    then have claude write names for isolating sizes


generate gameboards during downtime to dish out later


gameboards shouldn't contain >2 of the same letter


gameboards made with word injection should follow a distribution
    to ensure not every board will have a 14/15 letter word
    some boards may just have a 9/10 letter word
    this makes the highest scoring words rare
