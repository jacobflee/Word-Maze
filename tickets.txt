css sizing should fit a square screen (edge case)


consider in addSelectedCell making it class based (add remove class) instead of dom manipulation


recoop naming conventions they got way out of alignment
update vs set naming convention


consider cases in API and DB where you can replace ['attr'] with .attr


css is likely a mess needs to be looked at and cleaned
srange widths, 100% vs inherit, refine current organization
create css vars for named sizes like font size and width
    then have claude write names for isolating sizes


implement friend game
if friend game initiated make sure to check if username has changed


implement random game


generate gameboards during downtime to dish out later


gameboards shouldn't contain >2 of the same letter


gameboards made with word injection should follow a defined distribution
    to ensure not every board will have a 14/15 letter word
    some boards may just have a 9/10 letter word
    this makes the highest scoring words rare
