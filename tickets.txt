there is currently a lot of model logic and view logic and occuring in the Presenter
    like with specifying the button and mode (view)
    or with the switch statement for the mode (model)


fix naming (selectedLetters is current word text)


refactor to minimize dom repaints, anytime a style is set in js a repaint is triggered


implement local storage handler
    user id
        user name
        user ids (friends)
        user stats
            high_score
            longest_word
            game_count
            wins
            losses
            ties
            word_count
            word_length_distribution


after each game update local storage user stats


create screen to display user stats


create vars for named sizes like font size and width
    then have claude write names for isolating sizes


generate gameboards during downtime to dish out later


gameboards shouldn't contain >2 of the same letter


gameboards made with word injection should follow a distribution
    to ensure not every board will have a 14/15 letter word
    some boards may just have a 9/10 letter word
    this makes the highest scoring words rare
